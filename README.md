## Persistent Homology of Stack Overflow Tags
In my first project, I tried to [compute the persistent homology of the most popular Stack Overflow tags](https://github.com/daniel-rossano/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Persistent%20Homology%20SO%20Tags). Although it is not perfect, it was done to learn some techniques on working with large data sets in pandas. The project is saved as a Jupyter Notebook, and all relevant data has been made available along with the barcode and persistence diagram.
